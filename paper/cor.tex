This project researches \texttt{Prolog}'s \emph{Inductive Logic Programming} approach to learn parametrised rules describing \emph{Activities of Daily Life} based on data acquired form smart-houses: residences equipped with variety of sensors.\\

To this end, a highly customisable smart-house data generator is constructed and capabilities of \texttt{Aleph} inductive logic programming framework are assessed on various spatio-temporal datasets. Subsequently, an \emph{Activity Recognition Model} is constructed based on data collected from simulations and Washington State University CASAS smart-house installations. Both single and multiple occupiers models are considered.\\

To achieve the aforementioned goals, signal issues such as noise and incompleteness among others are addressed. Furthermore, a method for the raw data transformation into logical facts is proposed and evaluated. Difficulties such as real-valued sensor output and time representation in first-order logic are described.\\

The second objective of this work is to examine the structure of used spatio-temporal data with a view to discover and form new features. To this end, the dependencies between sensors are identified and assessed in order to construct more informative features. Hence by extending the dataset with new features performance of any classification algorithm can be significantly boosted.\\

Finally, this work opens up possibility of \emph{Narrative Analytics}: an extension of the Activity Recognition Model transforming generated rules into \emph{natural language}. The proposed data visualisation technique produces a plain English description of monitored residence, hence house situation can be examined without time consuming data interpretation.\\

The main utilisation of proposed here techniques is house monitoring for healthcare applications. SPHERE Project hosted at the University of Bristol addresses increasing healthcare costs and decreasing quality of life by designing tools and techniques allowing patients to live at home regardless of their medical conditions.\\
The activity recognition approach described here aims at improving the classification results and presenting smart-house data in a more transparent way. To the best of my knowledge, presented here methods are first of their kind and has not been yet described in any scientific publication.

  \section{The activity recognition problem}
    \subsection{Outline} %Problem outline
The main aim of the project is to build an \emph{activity recognition model} for a \emph{smart house} monitoring purposes.\\

By large, a smart house is a residence that is fitted with variety of sensors like: motion, door, appliance, water, item, etc.; as well as more sophisticated monitoring devices like cameras, and depth cameras. The first kind of sensors generate raw output usually of a form \texttt{sensorID on}/\texttt{sensorID off}, while the latter type outputs complex signal that needs to be pre-processed to be used as a classifier input. Due to these sensor characteristics my work mainly focuses on the first type of sensors.\\

The activity recognition model adjusted for the presented above scenario is a set of techniques that applied to a real time signals generated by a smart house predict currently held activity. In a single resident case the prediction target is only an activity like \emph{cooking} or \emph{sleeping}; when the house is occupied by multiple residents a \emph{person} performing the task is also outputted. The best solution to the outlined problem should work in \emph{signal streaming environment} therefore producing real-time activity predictions with high precision.

    \subsection{Motivation\label{sec:applications}} %Problem motivation/Applications
% Why interesting -> it generalises to any spatio-temporal data therefore can be used
The activity recognition model is a special case of a \emph{predictive model} for \emph{spatio-temporal} data. In general, such techniques predict quantity of interest based on input data, which encode both location and time of the event of interest. Smart-house signals are considered spatio-temporal as each sensor is associated with fixed location and the changes of sensor state are logged with date-time information.\\
% Why is it needed -> spatio-temporal data is everywhere,
This generalisation has a wide variety of real-life applications therefore addressing problems defined as ``hard'' in the activity recognition literature would make a valuable contribution to the field. 
The first and foremost area of application is healthcare.
% Population ageing - society geting older,  SPHERE project

      \subsubsection{Healthcare: The SPHERE Project}
Allowing elderly people and clinical patients to live at home regardless of the health conditions they suffer can greatly benefit such individuals. In general, dwelling in a cosy environment causes less stress. Moreover, the individuals living at home free space at specialistic day care centres and hospitals.\\
Therefore, being able to monitor behaviour of the patients staying in their own houses and effectively describe their activities result in better health care. Such techniques facilitate quick response to any kind of incidents without disturbing monitored people unless necessary.\\

  \caption{Percentage of world population over 65, 1950--2050; \citep{populationAgeing}.\label{fig:agingPopulatiom}}
\end{figure}

% The Challenge
The problems of ageing population (see \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:agingPopulatiom}}), global population health issues, increasing healthcare costs, and decreasing quality of life are addressed by the \emph{SPHERE Project} hosted at the University of Bristol \citep{sphere}. This collaboration of clinicians, engineers, designers, social care professionals and various members of the public develops helpful technologies addressing real healthcare problems in a cost effective way.\\
The project focuses on developing real-world technologies which are acceptable in people's homes i.e.\ do not hinder their everyday-life. SPHERE works on both hardware and software smart house solutions: sensors and wearable devices as well as algorithms for healthcare applications. The first, are fitted into the place of interest to monitor it---generate various kind of signals, while the latter use the acquired information to identify any medical or well-being issues: predict falls, detect strokes, analyse eating behaviours, and detect periods of depression or anxiety.\\

My project extends the algorithmic part of undertaken by SPHERE research: I propose here novel data analysis framework to enrich suite of used activity recognition models.

      \subsubsection{Smart City}
The spatio-temporal data feeds are also common in variety of monitoring applications. One of them described by \citet{filipponi2010smart} is smart-city management. Automatic---quick and robust---analysis of traffic information, accident reports, etc.\ is invaluable in case of emergencies.\\
Among many possible applications, the data analysis can result in timely police intervention or well planned route for emergency services, therefore help in evacuation, crowd management, terrorist attack prevention and airport security control.

      \subsubsection{Complex Systems}
The spatio-temporal data are also produced in large quantities by many of complex system monitoring and control devices of: scientific facilities, buildings, data centres~\citep{moore2005data} and power plants~\citep{amin2005toward}. 
The tasks impossible to handle by humans either due to large data volume throughput or demand for low response time are vast area of application for the spatio-temporal data analysis. Such tools facilitate well suited to the needs system management and risk detection for tasks like: power distribution and balancing, nuclear reactor control, and data centre heat management to name a few.

      \subsubsection{Wildlife}
Monitoring animals behaviour in their natural habitat is an important source of information for many researchers~\citep{Szewczyk:2004:HMS:990680.990704}. Unfortunately, this task is very often impractical either due to an adverse climate or difficult access to the monitored place. Moreover, in many cases scientists want to avoid disturbing animals' life-cycle and habitats. Difficult access to such sites can be easily overcame with wide range of available sensors and analytic tools, majority of which share common ground with activity recognition task.

  \section{Contribution}
    \subsection{Existing work}
Over the last few years, building machine learning models for \emph{Activities of Daily Living} (ADL) has become an interest of many researchers. Its wide area of applications and increasing complexity appearing with every new discovery attracts now and then machine learning community with new and innovative solutions.

    \subsubsection{Techniques}
Up to date, extensive work on the smart houses occupied by \emph{single}~\citep{cook2009assessing,fatima2013unified} and \emph{multiple}~\citep{hsu2010strategies,singla2010recognizing,crandall2009coping} residents has been done. Vast majority of these studies focuses on the state-of-the-art learning algorithms such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item transfer learning---\citet{cook2013transfer},
\item conditional random field---\citet{hsu2010strategies,van2010activity},
\item support vector machines with various kernels---\citet{fatima2013unified},
\item hidden Markov model---\citet{rashidi2011discovering},
\item na\"{\i}ve Bayes---\citet{cook2013activity},
\item artificial neural networks---\citet{fatima2013unified,fatima2013analysis}.
\end{itemize}

All of these models are fuelled by variety of features extracted from the raw signals by a transformation and time manipulation. Majority of the undertaken work in this field uses the motion sensors as the main source for the feature construction with little to none attention to the item sensors.\\

Unfortunately, the scientific environment focuses on the mainstream techniques and forgets about less popular techniques that are possibly simpler and more suitable. Observing this gap in the spatio-temporal data analysis opens a vast new area of research: building the activity recognition models with uncommon these days machine learning techniques.

      \subsubsection{Datasets}
Training and testing any activity recognition model requires a dataset of recorded human activities. Such data can be only obtained by designing and building a testbed house fitted with variety of sensors followed by numerous activity recording sessions. As majority of the researchers cannot invest time or money to construct a smart house they use publicly available datasets generated by one of the research facilities. The most popular choice~\citep{fatima2013unified,fatima2013analysis,nazerfard2010conditional,cook2009assessing} among researchers are datasets published by \citet{cook2009assessing} working at the \emph{Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems}, Washington State University; also known as \emph{CASAS datasets}.\\
Their popularity is based on a variety of recorded activities---scripted and unscripted, with both single and multiple residents, available publicly free of charge. Furthermore, they are in general well formatted and documented nevertheless, they sometimes show labelling structure inconsistency.

      \subsubsection{Issues}
Tasks such as activity recognition aim at predicting a nearly infinite amount of human activities which can be performed in variety of manners. This enormous complexity of the task causes numerous problems with the activity prediction and the assignment of one of the multiple residents to the performed task. Such ``multi layered'' predictions yield many possibilities of performance assessment e.g.\ correct activity---incorrect resident prediction; correct activity---correct resident prediction; etc..\\

Moreover, the literature identifies building models for some of the activities as relatively difficult. Many of them involve complex, time consuming tasks with multiple residents crossing each others paths.\\

Finally, due to specific to a dataset output formatting and sensor name-space majority of learnt models are neither universal nor transferable.

      \subsubsection{Outcomes}
Unfortunately, outcomes of the activity modelling tasks reported in the literature are poor reference for assessing any model performance. Used datasets and fitness measures varies depending on the study making the result comparison impractical.\\
For instance,~\citet{fatima2013analysis} report \emph{accuracy} ranging from $\sim0.2$ to $\sim1.0$ depending on the model type, target activity and used dataset.

    \subsection{Project contribution}
Broad activity recognition literature and variety of tested therein models clearly indicate that no single classifier can handle the diversity of activity structures embedded in the data. Each model has its pros and cons therefore perfect solution should use all of the models each offering features not covered by the others---the concept known as an \emph{ensemble learning}.\\

Careful examination of the literature reveals missing discussion of \emph{first-order formulas} i.e.\ parametrised logical rules, used as building blocks of the activity recognition model. My work comprehensibly covers this problem and expands collection of used techniques. Therefore, the main aim of the project is to apply an \emph{Inductive Logic Programming} (ILP) techniques to the spatio-temporal data acquired from ``smart'' installations---houses in particular---in order to build the \emph{Activity Recognition Model} and extract new, more informative features from the raw signals.\\

To address the first problem capabilities of an ILP system and possibilities of describing the model via a set of first-order logical rules are investigated. Both cases: the houses with a single and multiple occupiers are examined.\\
The latter task involves critical analysis of the smart house signals; activity specific feature design; and their quality assessment. Such novel signal characteristics can be then used in any other activity recognition model to boost its performance.\\

Designing a new activity model and signal features can become a difficult task when the exact structure of used dataset is unknown. Therefore, a systematic way of \emph{generating smart-house data} within user controlled environment is desirable. As part of this project a highly customisable data generator is proposed. Such a tool facilitates generating datasets representing activities of arbitrary complexity in the (in)deterministic world simulation, therefore a produced data can be used to build and test activity recognition models. Moreover, generated datasets are of invaluable help for systematic comparison of all the learning methods.\\

Finally, the project aims at proposing \emph{unified activity-recognition model evaluation measures}. A systematic way of assessing the performance of classifier in the activity recognition tasks is beneficial for comparing and contrasting multiple solutions. With such techniques an unambiguous assessment of multiple activity recognition methods is possible yielding straight forward identification of the best solution.

\section{Techniques}
To achieve outlined above goals the performance of proposed technique is evaluate on both \emph{CASAS datasets} and \emph{CASAS-inspired synthetic} datasets produced by the generator. Both datasets are translated from a log-like format into the \emph{knowledge representation} i.e.\ the sensor readings are expressed as logical facts. The classification result evaluation is made by the means of \emph{cross-validation}. CASAS datasets are split into separate trials to produce the folds; each containing all activities performed by a single experiment participant. On the other hand, when evaluating synthetic data each fold is generated independently with a common activity structure; small variation of order of used items; and multiple detours from originally planned motion trajectory.\\

% why I think it's best for the problem -> more details
The core of proposed technique is \texttt{Aleph}---Inductive Logic Programming system producing \texttt{Prolog} clauses as a data model. This approach to learning the activity recognition model was chosen as it lacks needed attention in the subject literature.\\
Proposed here rule based classifier greatly differs from currently used methods. Instead of employing \emph{propositional logic} it uses more powerful \emph{first-order logic} to express data and activity structure believes. More advanced ``grammar'' implies more possibilities to express the complex relations between the sensor events. This extra power can be harnessed to compose new data features, which in turn can be used in training other models and potentially improving their performance.\\

Furthermore, expressing the activity model in \texttt{Prolog} programming language brings to power all its advantages. Easy \emph{search space traversal} and built-in \emph{negation as failure} are invaluable tools in the feature construction process. Finally, learnt activity recognition model can be easily transformed to a \emph{generative model} for the data, hence serve as an activity example generator.\\
\texttt{Prolog} is also well known for its \emph{natural language processing} capabilities. A rule based model can be therefore used to produce \emph{Data Narrative}---a plain English interpretation of the data which supersedes any other visualisation technique targeted at the general public.\\

Another advantage of the ILP learning is use of a \emph{background knowledge}. It encodes \emph{clauses} needed to build the target model but can also contain any information or rules that might be beneficial for interacting with a raw data.\\
In the smart house model such component is of invaluable help as it can contain all the house and activity details that are absent in the raw data. Room layout, sensor placement, activity structure are just some of them.\\
Moreover, the background knowledge acts as a \emph{proxy} between the raw data and the model, making the latter universal. It means that in majority of cases the model learnt for one dataset can be applied to any other by using the data-specific background knowledge.\\

Very often the monitored activities exhibit hierarchy and structure. A rule based model allows to easily adjust the \emph{resolution of prediction}, therefore the activities can be described with a different level of depth. Considering the activity of eating, the model can simply predict the activity: \emph{eating}; it can also suggest the meal type (breakfast, lunch, brunch, etc.) based on the time of day; or even the food type (pasta, pizza, etc.) based on used ingredients.\\

A rule based model has one more distinctive feature not exhibited by many other machine learning models: it is \emph{human readable}. Such models are easy to inspect and tune simply by reading and modifying them. Moreover, the model rules can be easily evaluated whether they make sense. They can also help to discover any obscure information encoded in the data, hence gained knowledge can be used to design new, more suitable features in iterative manner. Rule manipulation is also feasible, therefore they can be simplified---by removing a predicate, extended---by appending a predicate, or combined---by enclosing them in a meta-rule.

\section{Deliverables}
% Deliverables / contribution -> what the project will result in
The project delivers a highly customizable smart-house data generator written in \texttt{Python}. It is publicly available as a \texttt{Git} repository\footnote{\noindent\url{https://github.com/So-Cool/SHgen}} to help researchers with training and testing the activity recognition models.\\
The smart-house simulator is highly customisable: room layout, motion and item sensor placement, and number of occupiers can be specified. The user designs an \emph{action script} which is then ``reconstructed'' by the house occupiers, what in turn produces sensor activations which are recorded in CASAS-like format.\\
As all the actions are ``directed'' a precise \emph{ground truth} information is available. Presence of the \emph{activity labels} in the data and precise control over the sensor interactions is of invaluable help in experiments of this kind. Finally, the data generator is proved to produces real-like data, therefore it is sound for use in the model creation and evaluation.\\
The generator repository contains detailed design and usage description to be easy to set-up and use for anybody. The choice of programming language was made based on its popularity making contribution, maintenance and development easy for the whole community.\\

Moreover, the project studies in great detail application of the ILP to various smart house settings. The knowledge representation of the house signals is proposed. Activity recognition problems defined in the literature as ``hard'' for both single and multiple residents are attempted and quality of results is discussed. The capabilities, limitations and advantages of the ILP in described scenario is thoroughly investigated and illustrated with examples. The role of the background knowledge encoding additional signal characteristics is examined. Used signal features are described and their role in the model construction is critically evaluated. Finally, the result evaluation techniques are proposed and used to score achieved results.

\section{Challenges}
Issues in all the layers: data, ILP and result evaluation arise. To overcome them, multiple solutions are presented and tested to select the best possible one for the smart house data analysis.\\

% prediction continuity issues, and readings in time continuity issues
Very often the data collected from smart-houses are corrupted or obscure due to incompleteness and sensor noise. This phenomenon leads to confusing gaps between ``observed'' actions causing model learning difficulties and intermittent prediction space. With help of the inductive learning such implicit information---describing intermediate steps between actions---can be inferred to overcome the rule creation difficulty and produce logically consistent scenario.\\
Moreover, the output of smart house installations is an unlabelled dataset. Filling the missing activity description is a manual labour, hence it is time consuming and prone to errors. Lack of the reliable ground truth information very often causes model learning difficulties.\\

Representing data in first-order logic has many advantages but it causes problems with unbounded variables like real numbers. This drawback imposes limitations on a time and real-valued sensor output representation which is crucial for a spatio-temporal data. Discovering possible representations and evaluating their usefulness is of great importance.\\

Learning a data model with the ILP is a complex process with number of intermediate steps. First, the learning environment of \texttt{Aleph} framework has to be configured to build the activity recognition model. For this purpose possible formats of the activity rule have to be discovered. Then, datasets and activity scripts need to be analysed to find any structures that can be used as the signal features. To this end, mechanism in a form of \texttt{Prolog} rules extracting quantities of interest form the raw data has to be built.\\
Background knowledge---the main component of \texttt{Aleph}---is a powerful tool. To make the best use of it, its capabilities and limitations must be discovered. To this end, usefulness of information not contained in the original dataset like room and sensor layout has to be assessed. Well designed background knowledge can significantly improve quality of used signal features.\\

Adjusting the resolution (level of detail) of achieved prediction is also an important task. Therefore, right balance in prediction detail and accuracy trade-off has to be found.\\
Handling data of a house occupied by multiple residents introduces difficulty of distinguishing them. Well known problem of agents sharing common space or crossing each other paths has to be resolved.\\

Finally, designing the most suitable an universal evaluation technique is crucial for results comparison. The main difficulty of this task are multiple classification error possibilities. The significance of each of them has to be considered to build performance metric that express real-life usefulness of proposed methodology.

\section{Result evaluation}
For the proposed generator to be publicly accepted in the community dealing with smart house activity recognition the proof of producing real-like data is necessary. Presented here proof is based on comparison of the activity models learn on the real and synthetic data and aims at assessing their similarities.\\

% OUtput asses ->
To prove importance of presented here activity recognition work a systematic and versatile evaluation technique is necessary. Firstly, a similar technique to the generator evaluation is used: comparison of models learnt on synthetic and genuine data. Moreover, the results of the rule based classifiers are compared against ``default accuracy'' i.e.\ accuracy achieved by \emph{majority class classification}.\\
Evaluation measures such as accuracy, precision, recall and F-measure are used. Overall, per activity, per person per activity statistics are presented. Furthermore, for single occupier cases the raw signals are translated into \texttt{ARFF} format and different machine learning models from \texttt{Weka} package are applied to them.\\
Finally, almost all presented here evaluation is based on \emph{cross validation} to make it more robust. The genuine data is split per trial so that each fold contains 5 different activities. The synthetic data is generated with random bits based on script corresponding to the genuine data.

\chapter{Spatio-temporal data\label{ch:stData}}
Spatio-temporal datasets are made of entries encoding event and their occurrence times. Such data are generated by monitoring systems, logging utilities and all kind of smart-instillations like houses and cities. Majority of such datasets are streamed therefore it is implicitly assumed that learning algorithm at any point can look into the past but never see future.\\
This assumption can be utilised in learning algorithms by allowing current prediction to be based on past predictions. Such practice is widely used to boost classifier performance, nevertheless, it bears danger of skewing future predictions by propagating early made error.

  \section{The smart-house data}
My work focuses on smart-house outputs, which is the most popular case of spatio-temporal data. Each entry in such dataset is generated by change of sensor state and is characterised with \emph{time stamp}, \emph{sensor ID} and new \emph{sensor state}.\\
Smart-house data owe their popularity mainly due to importance of activity recognition models (see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:applications}}). Moreover, such datasets can be arbitrary complex as there exist infinite amount of activities that they can represent. Therefore, techniques designed for smart-house data can be generalised for other spatio-temporal cases which usually exhibit less complexity.

    \subsection{CASAS dataset\label{sec:csasDataDet}}
Washington State University's CASAS project~\citep{cook2009assessing} is main source of real smart-house datasets used in this study. These datasets are very popular in activity recognition literature due to their large quantity, recorded in variety of testbeds with diverse sensor types: electricity, motion, door, item and appliance (fixed-phone, water, hob). Furthermore, they contain vast amount of activities of different complexity performed by single and multiple occupiers.\\
The datasets structure is transparent, with list of sensor readings, one entry per line of the form:
$$
\text{\texttt{Date}~~\texttt{Time}~~\texttt{SensorID}~~\texttt{SensorState}~~(\texttt{PersonID\_ActivityID}~~\texttt{ActivityState}).}
$$
First four columns are compulsory. 5\ts{th} and 6\ts{th} sparse column is ground truth information and denote blocks of activities, which in multiple resident case are tagged with resident identifier. \texttt{ActivityID} is a name of activity like \emph{cooking}; \texttt{PersonID} is a resident identifier like \emph{residentA}; and \texttt{ActivityStatus} can be either \emph{begin} or \emph{end} where sensor activations placed between these commands contribute to defined activity.\\
Snippets of CASAS dataset are shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:CASASoneR}} for single resident and in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:CASAStwoR}} for two residents.

      \subsubsection{Single resident}
The two most popular CASAS datasets for single resident are \emph{\#1 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Normal Testbed} and \emph{\#2 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Error Testbed}, hence, both are used in my project. The testbed---house and sensor---layout is shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:house:oner}}.

      \subsubsection{Multiple residents}
\emph{\#7 WSU Smart Apartment 2009 Two Resident Testbed} is the most popular choice among studies for multiple residents model training and testing. Its testbed design is presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:house:twor}}, with cabinet sensor layout same as in single resident case---shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:house:oner:b}}.\\

In multiple resident case the sensor set is extended with:
\begin{description}
\item[T$\Bigcdot\Bigcdot\Bigcdot$] temperature sensors; numerical, real-valued signal given in Celsius degrees; and
\item[P$\Bigcdot\Bigcdot\Bigcdot$] electricity usage meter; numerical, integer-valued signal given in kiloWatt Hours.
\end{description}

This dataset was generated with two residents (\textbf{R$\Bigcdot$}): \textbf{R1} and \textbf{R2}, performing their \emph{normal daily activities} (not scripted), therefore, their details are unknown:\\[1em]

    \subsection{CASAS issues\label{sec:dataIssues}}
CASAS are the best smart-house datasets that can be used for modelling activity recognition. Unfortunately, they exhibit issues common for every real datasets. Issues such as:
\begin{description}
\item[noise] random sensor activations;
\item[sensor failures] lack of sensor state change notification despite its proper usage; and
\item[incompleteness] signal discontinuity e.g.\ double sensor activation without deactivation in-between
\end{description}
can be identified. All of them cause difficulties in learning activity recognition model.\\

Furthermore, CASAS specific drawbacks hinder their usage. Numeric output of water and burner sensors is unexplained. Additional, for multiple residents datasets not all ground truth activity facts are assigned to people. Also, activities in the latter case are neither scripted nor explained in detail therefore sensor output is tedious to analyse. Without good understanding of human action effects on sensor activations it is relatively hard to design activity recognition model.\\

As ILP activity learning is not documented precise data is required to evaluate its pros and cons. Hence, highly customisable smart-house data generator is required.

  \section{The smart-house generator}
Smart-house data generator created as part of this project is intended to help in activity recognition model design, training and testing. It is highly customisable, hence, it gives user great control over generated data.\\

The user can designing activities of arbitrary structure and complexity and use them to simulate corresponding smart-house output. Then, he can attempt to learn the structure encoded within it. As he knows activity details, he can bypass real data issues (see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:dataIssues}}) and focus on tuning the model. Overcoming one issue at the time greatly benefits model quality and helps to identify its strong and weak points.\\

The tool is open source and published as a \texttt{GitHub} repository together with complete documentation describing design choices, usage details and input-output examples.

    \subsection{Capabilities}
To use the generator, firstly, the user has to describe house by stating room interconnections in form of adjacency matrix.\\

Then, room layout and sensors placement within each room needs to be specified. The room dimensions are required together with list of wanted sensors. The design is based on Cartesian coordinates with origin in bottom left corner of the room.\\
For motion sensors: ID, position and range has to be specified. Sensors of these type detect motion radially from their location.\\
Item sensors are defined with: ID, position, and its human readable name.\\
Finally, door location is needed for layout completeness. They are encoded with \texttt{door} keyword, their coordinates and name of a room they lead to.\\
Example definition of each sensor type (order preserved) is given in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:sensorLayout}}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\lstset{
  captionpos=b,
  frame=single,
  backgroundcolor=\color{Bkgd},

i78  5.5 0.5 phone_book
door 0   0.5 hall
  \end{lstlisting}
  \caption{Example sensor definitions.\label{lst:sensorLayout}}
\end{figure}

Subsequently, item sensors characteristics have to be specified. Each item, like TV, takes some time to use---average TV watching time. It is simulated by drawing a sample of Gaussian distribution with user specified mean and standard deviation. This feature is mainly used for simple activities but the time can be altered in activity specification script (see next paragraph).\\
Walking is simulated in the same way---single step size and time together with their standard deviations have to be specified.\\

Finally, activity script used to simulate interaction with sensors has to be provided. Arbitrary number of activities (they can be nested) for multiple people can be defined. Each script is specified with start position and any of the following atomic actions can be issued: go to room, go to location within the room, use item (simulate previously defined time), pick up any item or start any device, put down the item or turn off the device. For more complex activities any command can be used between starting/taking and stopping/returning any device/item.\\
Curly brackets together with activity name are used to surround atomic actions contributing towards this activity. Example script is given in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:path}}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\lstset{
  captionpos=b,
  frame=single,
  backgroundcolor=\color{Bkgd},

  \caption{Example activity script.\label{lst:path}}
\end{figure}

Presented here tool is capable of generating arbitrarily complex user defined activities by specifying their atomic actions. The generator can simulate multiple residents interacting with the house simultaneously.\\
Additionally to CASAS-like signal output, precise ground truth is recorded.\\

Datasets generated for ILP activity recognition models are using house design presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:simHouse}} with systematic grid of motion sensors fitted within each room.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering% [width=.9\textwidth]
  \includegraphics[height=7.3cm]{./gfx/room_layout}
  \caption{Simulated house room layout.\label{fig:simHouse}}
\end{figure}

    \subsection{Advantages}
Created smart-house data generator is flexible and highly customisable. The simulated resident can perform tasks of arbitrary complexity ranging from simple motion to nested activities each using different combination of available items. Moreover, the output signal can be distorted with various kinds of noise and randomness.\\

The main advantage of proposed here simulation technique is detailed knowledge of ground truth, which is based on input activity script. Availability of various kind of simulation statistics can be used to visualise sensor behaviour and debug activity model trained on generated data.\\

Finally, the raw signal output of the generator is given in widely accepted CASAS format. Therefore, simulations made with described here tool can be used with all activity recognition systems based on CASAS datasets.

    \subsection{ILP ready}
The smart-house data generator was designed with ILP model construction in mind, therefore, it outputs \texttt{Prolog} facts needed for this purpose. Information such as house specific background knowledge and positive \& negative examples required by ILP algorithm is recorded.\\
Additionally, detailed sensor activations, time-location and activity structure informations are available for manual analysis of output signal.

    \subsection{Proof of concept}
The value of presented here smart-house data generator can increase significantly if it can be proven to produce real-like datasets. Proof for single resident case is sufficient as multiple residents house is based on combination of multiple single agent simulations. The latter effect is achieved by special handling (preserving sensor states) of cases when agents cross each other's paths and interact with common device or item.\\

Presented here data generator evaluation is based on \emph{similarity comparison} of ILP models learnt on CASAS \#1 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Normal Testbed and synthetic datasets. I chose this particular genuine data as they are provided with detailed activity scripts (see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:csasDataDet}}) and testbed layout (see \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:house:oner}}) hence its simulations should result in faithful reproductions.\\

<DATA MISSING>

  \section{Knowledge representation of spatio-temporal data}
Activity learning method described here requires signals represented as logical facts. ILP system used in this study is written in \texttt{Prolog} programming language therefore, all data has to be expressed in thereof predicates. This requirement causes some problems introduced by sensor type variety.\\

The most common sensor output are binary variables: on-off, present-absent, opened-closed, etc.\ produced by motion and item sensors. Expressing them in predicates is straight-forward as their search space is finite---a set containing two elements.

    \subsection{Unbounded sensor readings}
Another type of sensor output are real and whole numbers. Handling these quantities is well known and broadly documented issue in Artificial Intelligence and Logic Programming. As \texttt{Prolog} is a language based on search space traversal numbers i.e.\ unbounded variables have infinite (unbounded) search space.\\

When sensor output is numerical it is converted to Boolean space by simple shareholding. The critical value is hand-picked based on observation of output values.\\
A special case of unbounded readings is time.

    \subsection{Time representation\label{sec:timeRepresentation}}
Date-time is complex object encoding many useful information. Unfortunately, its human readable format---YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:SS.ssssss---is of no use in computer science. Converted to machine language it is expressed as a \emph{timestamp}---number of seconds elapsed since epoch dated on 00:00:00, 1\ts{st} January 1970, UTC.\\

For my study I chose to represent time in 4 different way:
\begin{description}
\item[absolute] is timestamp represented in micro-seconds ($\mu$-seconds: $10^{16}s$) rather than seconds,
\item[relative] is number of micro-seconds elapsed since first sensor activation in the dataset,
\item[sequenced] is a sequential number of sensor activation in the dataset starting with $0$,
\item[windowed] is sequential number of fixed-time-interval window that the event fall into; the first time-windows starts on first sensor activation and has ID $0$; window of 5 seconds is used in the study.
\end{description}
Representation examples are shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:timerepresentation}}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
sensor(m12, true, relative, 4007842 ).
sensor(m12, true, absolute, 1430004781866056 ).
sensor(m12, true, sequence, 2 ).
sensor(m12, true, windowed, 0 ).

sensor(m13, false, relative, 5994214 ).
sensor(m13, false, absolute, 1430004783852428 ).
sensor(m13, false, sequence, 3 ).
sensor(m13, false, windowed, 1 ).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Signal represented as \texttt{Prolog} facts.\label{lst:timerepresentation}}
\end{figure}

As no single time representation is best for ILP application all four were tested and evaluated. \emph{Sequence} is most suitable in search space environment---the numbers are not sparse therefore the application can easily iterate through them without large computational overhead.\\
For this reason I chose this representation as the main time format. Despite being helpful in ILP scenario sequential number is highly uninformative. It lacks basic information such as time of day or possibility to be transformed into time elapsed since last sensor reading.\\

To enrich source of information used by learning algorithm \emph{timestamp} representation is used. Following directly from sequence number it can be easily accessed. With such detailed representation of micro-second accuracy, precise time elapsed since any event can be calculated.\\
Moreover this value can be thresholded hence discretised to produce bounded variables such as:
\begin{description}
\item[time of year] winter, summer, autumn, spring;
\item[month] January, February, March, etc.;
\item[time of day] morning, afternoon, evening, night;
\end{description}
and similar. In particular, in ILP and AI such values a lot easier to work with than numbers.\\

The remaining two representations: \emph{relative} and \emph{windowed} are of little use in presented here learning approach.

    \subsection{Background knowledge\label{sec:data:bkg}}
Background knowledge is a general name for a place containing all the information relevant to model learning. By far, it is the most important component of ILP containing building blocks of target model. Moreover, it is a place for logical representation of signals and all relevant rules interacting with them. Additionally, it contains any information not contained or implicit in the raw signals.\\

From large enough sample of smart-house data it is feasible to infer room layout and interconnections, unfortunately this task is computationally complex and impractical in most cases. ILP comes with help in such scenarios as it is ready to use any information not given in raw signals by reading it from background knowledge. Room connections information is great feature as it helps to predict motion trajectory and person's location.\\
Sensor allocation---placement in rooms---is another information not given in raw signal. With help of sensors location, sensor activations can be translated into room name in which the activity is happening.\\
Examples of information used in the background knowledge file is given in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:bg}}. Fact \texttt{connected\_\_} informs about room connections via doors; \texttt{sensorInRoom} contains information where sensor of given ID is placed; \texttt{sensorActivity} is used with all item and appliance sensors and assigns human readable name to sensor ID; finally, \texttt{sensorInField} tells in range of which motion sensor item or appliance is located.\\

\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}

aPriori(phone , phone_call).

bedroom(residentA, bedroom1).
bedroom(residentB, bedroom2).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Background knowledge facts snippet.\label{lst:bg}}
\end{figure}

Apart from house layout information \emph{prior believes} of any kind can be used in background knowledge---see \texttt{aPriori} keyword \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:bg}}. A priori information such as likely place of activity, device or item required to complete it, and the order of activities are of invaluable help. For example, watching TV is most often associated with living room and a meal cannot be eaten unless it has been cooked. It is a fact that watching television requires TV to be on, cooking is happening on a hob and to make a phone call one needs to use a phone.\\
With multiple residents in a house information such as bedroom assignment helps to distinguish them (\texttt{bedroom} keyword in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:bg}}).\\

\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}

   sensor_state(SensorID, true, Time),

  ;( !, Time > 0,
    location(Time-1, Location) ).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Example rule.\label{lst:bg:rule}}
\end{figure}

Another component of background knowledge are \texttt{Prolog} rules interacting with facts and signals---they can be understood as \emph{feature extractors}. Rule example is shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:bg:rule}}; it queries \emph{where} (room name) a person is at given \emph{time}.\\

Background knowledge can be also understood as \emph{proxy} between raw signals and high level activity rules. As output rules are based on room, item, appliance names and not sensor IDs they are universal. Already existing model can be applied to any other house by using specific to that place background knowledge.\\
Finally, learnt rules can be used in future iterations of learning process by appending them to the background knowledge.


    \subsection{Positives and negatives\label{sec:data:posneg}}
The final component of ILP are positive and negative examples of model to learn. Sample facts for both single and multiple occupiers are presented respectively in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:singleposneg}}~\&~\emph{\ref{lst:multiposneg}}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}

activity(eat   , 51).
activity(eat   , 52).

activity(washUp, 59).
activity(washUp, 60).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Positives and negatives for single resident.\label{lst:singleposneg}}
\end{figure}

These examples use \emph{sequence} representation of time to express when (and by whom) activity \emph{is}: positives, and \emph{is not}: negatives done. Both types have common structure and are separated into two different files to be distinguishable.\\

\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(sleep, 14, residentA).
activity(sleep, 15, residentA).

activity(useBathroom, 5, residentB).
activity(useBathroom, 6, residentB).
activity(useBathroom, 7, residentB).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Positives and negatives for multiple resident.\label{lst:multiposneg}}
\end{figure}

For each activity the sets of positive and negative examples have to be disjoint with regard to time. The ILP system generalises positive examples into complex rules containing in body references to sensor states under restriction of not covering any or some negative examples.

  \section{The converter}
The next step in model learning is data conversion from CASAS-like log format to \texttt{Prolog} \emph{knowledge representation} i.e.\ state signal readings as logical facts. The converter is capable of handling both single and multiple residents datasets. To this end, number of conversion steps is need.\\

Real-valued signals like AD1-B water sensor (see \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:CASASoneR}}) are threshold and discretised. Binary sensor output is unified to values \emph{true} and \emph{false}. The time-date information is converted into four described in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:timeRepresentation}} representation.\\
Moreover, the converter uses activity and person ID information given in 4\ts{th} and 5\ts{th} column of the data to generate positive and negative examples needed for learning activity model with \texttt{Aleph}.

  \section{The cross-validation}
Once the data is converted and passed to \texttt{Aleph} the model in form of rules describing activities is produced. To evaluate their quality 10-fold cross-validation is performed.\\
For each script of activities 10 data recordings are gathered together with corresponding model learnt with ILP. Then, each sample model is evaluated on the remaining nine datasets and the results are checked against corresponding ground truth. After testing all possible model-data combinations overall and per-label accuracy and is reported. The output of cross-validation framework is on of the diagnostics used to evaluate model performance.

\chapter{Inductive Logic Programming\label{ch:ILP}}
\citet{plotkin1972automatic} in early 1970s and \citet{shapiro1983algorithmic} in early 1980s created foundation of \emph{Inductive Logic Programming} (ILP). Both authors introduced techniques and tools to learn \emph{first-order formulas} (parametrised rules that are the core of the ILP) describing chosen object based on a set of facts. Since then, ILP techniques found number of interdisciplinary applications with new tools being created now and then for rules learning purposes.

  \section{Inductive Logic Programming}
The concept of Inductive Logic Programming is based on fusion of two well known techniques: \emph{inductive learning} and \emph{logic programming}. The first component facilitates building model from available observations and generating new knowledge form experience. The latter, introduces a powerful representation of knowledge as \emph{first-order logical rules}~\citep{muggleton1994inductive,muggleton1995inverse}.

    \subsection{Logic programming}
\emph{Propositional logic} widely used in machine learning models is ``\emph{weaker}'' than first-order logic used in ILP. A propositional sentences (rules) are made of facts combined with \emph{logical connectives} such as: not ($\neg$), and ($\land$), or ($\lor$), existence ($\exists$), etc.. Such sentence can only be evaluated to true or false based on predicates in its body e.g.\
$$\left(\left(\texttt{sensorM42} \land \texttt{sensorM47}\right) \lor \left(\texttt{sensorM27} \land \texttt{sensorM30}\right)\right) \land time = 40$$
where \texttt{sensor$\Bigcdot\Bigcdot\Bigcdot$} denotes sensor $\Bigcdot\Bigcdot\Bigcdot$ being on, is true if either both \texttt{sensorM42} and \texttt{sensorM47} or \texttt{sensorM27} and \texttt{sensorM30} are simultaneously on at time $40$.\\

Thanks to first-order logic ILP overcomes mentioned above ``limited representation formalism'' (expressing data in form of a propositional logic). Many problems considered hard to solve while expressed propositionally can be easily tackled with ILP. The power of first-order logic lies in expressing its sentences with \emph{parametrised} predicates. Use of domain specific quantified variables alters logical state of sentence based on their input and output therefore facilitates expressing complex relations. An example of first-order activity rule: \texttt{activity(A,B)} where variable \texttt{A} denotes activity ID and \texttt{B} time, is given below. The rule illustrates the dependence between predicates via free variables.\\
\begin{eqnarray*}
&\texttt{activityOrder(B,A)} \land \texttt{location(B,livingRoom)} \land \\
&\texttt{outOfCabinet(B,C)} \land \texttt{medicineInList(C)}
\end{eqnarray*}
The major limitation of first-order logic is its restriction to finite variable domains---it cannot describe rules built on infinite sets like real or natural numbers.\\

Finally, ILP does not have difficulties in incorporating substantial background knowledge in form of first-order sentences to the model. This feature is not very common among machine learning models, nevertheless, use of domain knowledge is ``essential for intelligent behaviour''~\citep{muggleton1994inductive}.

    \subsection{Inductive learning}
The second component of ILP is inductive learning: constructing \emph{first-order clausal theories}. Such hypotheses are based on combining background knowledge with facts representation of positive and negative examples; see \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:ilp}}.\\
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=.5]{./gfx/ilp}
  \caption{ILP scheme\label{fig:ilp}}
\end{figure}
ILP aims at building theory that under consideration of background knowledge explains facts: covers as much positive examples as possible without covering and or most of negative examples. To this end, it uses \emph{induction} as a basic mode of inference: generalization of specific observations to theories, rather than deduction: transforming general theories to the more specific clauses.

    \subsection{Applications}
The rules produced with ILP are human readable unlike models produced by majority of machine learning solutions, what gives it great advantage over competition. Easy to understand rules means that the logic models are arguably easy to manipulate. They can be changed by simply adding, deleting, and modifying clauses or literals.\\
Such model representation is invaluable in \emph{scientific theory formation} and problems where data cannot be easily represented in attribute-vale language. ILP is widely used in structure-activity prediction for drug design~\citep{king1992drug,michael1992modelling} and protein secondary-structure prediction~\citep{muggleton1992protein}. It is also popular tool in computer science as: programming assistance, algorithmic debugging, program testing and verification, and reverse engineering~\citep{shapiro1983algorithmic,bergadno1993inductive,bratko1993inductive}.\\

The two most popular \texttt{Prolog} ILP implementations are \texttt{Aleph}\footnote{\url{http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/aleph.html}} and \texttt{Progol}\footnote{\url{http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~shm/progol.html}}. \texttt{Aleph} is chosen for this study due to its comprehensive documentation availability and ease of use on contemporary platforms.

  \section{\texttt{Aleph}}
\texttt{Aleph}: A Learning Engine for Proposing Hypotheses, is \texttt{Prolog} based Inductive Logic Programming system developed at Oxford University by \citeauthor{muggleton1994inductive}. It is compatible with two most popular \texttt{Prolog} language implementations: \texttt{YAP}---Yet Another Prolog, and \texttt{SWI-Prolog}.

    \subsection{Input files}
\texttt{Aleph} infers hypotheses using three files, the first two contain positive and negative examples of target rule model, the third encodes program settings and additional informations.

      \subsubsection{Background}
Background file contains \texttt{Aleph} configuration and target model specification; see example given in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephSettings}}. Settings such as used evaluation function, allowed maximal number of negative examples covered by a single target rule, and minimal number of positive examples that each rule has to cover are used.\\
Additionally, user provides target rule specification. Based on presented example the target \texttt{activity} rule has $2$ variables (is of \emph{arity} $2$): (constant, \#) activity ID and (input, +) integer representing time. The body of the rule can contain arbitrary number of \texttt{device} and \texttt{location} predicates each having $2$ variables. The first takes integer time input and constant device ID; the latter integer time input and constant room ID.\\
Finally, target model constrains can be specified (\texttt{false} keyword): in presented example no two activities can happen at the same time.\\
\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
% Internal settings
:- set(evalfn, wracc).
:- set(noise , 3    ).
:- set(minpos, 1    ).
% Determinations
:- determination(activity/2, device/2  ).
:- determination(activity/2, location/2).
% Mode declarations: rule head definition
:- modeh(*, activity(#activityIDs, +integer) ).
% Rule body definition
:- modeb(*, device(+integer, #deviceIDs)).
:- modeb(*, location(+integer, #roomIDs)).
% Constrains
false :-
  activity(Activity1, T),
  activity(Activity2, T),
  not(Activity1 = Activity2).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Example \texttt{Aleph} settings.\label{lst:alephSettings}}
\end{figure}
Therefore, target rules are of the form \texttt{activity(ActivityID, Time) :- $\Bigcdot$}.\\

Additionally to presented above \texttt{Aleph} settings, background knowledge file also contains facts and rules discussed is \emph{Section~\ref{sec:data:bkg}}.

      \subsubsection{Positives}
Positive examples file lists activity facts of the form \texttt{activity(ActivityID, Time).} to indicate at which time points the activity was happening in a data. Example file is discussed in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:data:posneg}}.

      \subsubsection{Negatives}
Negative examples file is of the same form as positive example file. It indicates time-points when activities were not undertaken. In presented here learning scenario the negative time-points are set complement of positives examples and are bounded from below by $0$ and from above by number of sensor readings in the data set; see \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:timepoints}} for reference. Example file is discussed in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:data:posneg}}.
\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=.85\textwidth]{./gfx/activityStructure}
  \caption{Activity structure example.\label{fig:timepoints}}
\end{figure}

    \subsection{\texttt{Aleph} output}
Based on input data \texttt{Aleph} outputs set of rules compliant with given specification. Presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephSettings}} settings could result in first from the top rule given in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephOut}}. It does not contain free variables in the body hence can be expressed in propositional logic.\\
The second one is more complex yet still propositional. \texttt{outOfCabinet(A,[none])} predicate gives list of items taken out of cupboard at time \texttt{A}.\\
The third activity rule is a \emph{singularity}. Positive example \texttt{activity(clean,87).} is outputted as the ILP algorithm could not generalised it to proper rule without breaking any of the restrictions imposed by the background file. Such rules are pruned out prior to cross-validation.\\
\begin{figure}[htb] % [breaklines]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(wash_hands,A) :-
  device(A,water_hot).

activity(wash_hands,A) :-
  outOfCabinet(A,[none]),
  waterUsed(A).

activity(clean,87).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Example activity model.\label{lst:alephOut}}
\end{figure}

An example of more advanced, first-order logical rule is presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:bg:rule}}. Free variables present in the rule body ensure clauses interaction.

    \subsection{The basic algorithm}
Generally speaking, inductive logic programming is a \emph{search problem}. The algorithm traverses through \emph{candidate solution space} i.e.\ set of ``well-formed'' hypotheses, to find the most suitable one. ILP problem can be solved using na\"{\i}ve generate and test algorithm however, this approach is highly inefficient. The most suitable solution has four steps: select example, build most-specific-clause, search, and remove redundancies~\citep{muggleton1994inductive}.

      \subsubsection{Select example}
Select positive example that is not yet covered by learnt rule form the positives set. If all were tested stop the procedure.

      \subsubsection{Build most-specific-clause}
Also known as \emph{saturation step}. Construct \emph{bottom clause}: definite clause with many literals that is most specific given that it entails previously selected example and complies with provided restrictions.

      \subsubsection{Search}
Also known as \emph{reduction step}. Search through subsets of previously found literals to build more general clause that complies with given restriction.\\
More general clause can improved performance by covering more than one positive example.

      \subsubsection{Remove redundancies}
Also known as \emph{cover removal}. Memorise the clause with the best score (coverage) and remove positive examples made redundant (covered) by new clause. Return to \emph{Select example} step.

  \section{Applications to spatio-temporal data}
With a bit of tuning ILP can be applied to spatio-temporal data with quite good results. Despite difficulty in handling numerical values rule based model is highly suitable for activity recognition task.\\

Arbitrary information that can be appended to background knowledge greatly improves raw signal handling. \texttt{Prolog's} \emph{negation as failure} is consistent with lacking sensor state. \texttt{Prolog} assumes that any sensor is off if it cannot be ``proven'' to be on; regardless of whether it does not exist at all or it has not been activated yet, hence, according to data it is neither on nor off. This approach helps in smoothing out sensor readings e.g.\ if current location cannot be inferred from available sensor readings the model assumes last known location.\\

Moreover, output model written in \texttt{Prolog} is human readable therefore relations in data revealed by ILP can be understood and used to improve the model. The output theory can be also easily modified and enclosed within meta-rules. This practice is an easy fix for prediction continuity issue.\\

Finally, expressing hierarchy in rule based model can be easily achieved by placing one rule in the body of the other or conditioning only on some subset of body literals. The concepts of rule generalisation and specialisation directly correspond to moving up and down the hierarchical structure.

  \section{Closed Concept \& Least General Generalisation\label{sec:closedConcept}}
A \emph{closed concept} is a concept that includes all implicitly understood conditions. For example rule:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(wash_hands,A) :-
  device(A,water_hot),
  location(A,kitchen).
\end{minted}
and:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(wash_hands,A) :-
  device(A,water_hot).
\end{minted}
both have the same coverage of positive examples, but the first is more general, therefore, it is a closed concept. In other words, it is the \emph{least general generalisation} (LGG) of chosen positive example.\\

Due to \texttt{Aleph} search step, bottom clause i.e.\ LGG of currently selected positive example, is pruned of redundant (from performance perspective) literals, hence, activity details are lost. In the example given above location of washing hands is reduced. These disregarded informations are of great importance for feature construction and data narrative (see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:narrative}}).\\

It is possible to generate closed concept of activity rules in \texttt{Aleph} by disabling search step. To achieve this, search setting has to be overwritten: \texttt{:- set(search, false).}.

  \section{Feature discovery and feature extraction}
Building a data model with ILP requires right features to be available in background knowledge. By large, ILP algorithm searches through feature space to find their most suitable combination for each activity model. In presented here scenario features are understood as rules interacting with both, raw signals and each other in order to extract knowledge relevant to model.\\
Designing such rules can be understood as feature construction and requires awareness of ``activity script'' used to generate the data regardless of their origin: simulation or human actor interacting with smart-house. ``Activity script'' can be both: general description of activities or ordered list of tasks to be perform by an agent.\\

Rule body of output activity model can be then examined to analyse relations between features and activities. Interesting predicates can be then applied directly to raw dataset to generate new feature vectors. It is widely known that well crafted features can boost performance of any machine learning model. Additionally, more informative LGG of output rules can be checked.\\
Features used for both single and multiple resident models are discussed in detail in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:single:features}~\&~\ref{sec:multiple:features}}.

\chapter{Activity recognition model}
The aim of the activity recognition model is to predict agent's \emph{actions} at \emph{time} of interest based on sensor signals delivered by smart-house. Therefore, the target rule needs input variable \texttt{Time} and output variable \texttt{Activity} leading to:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(Activity, Time) :-
  ruleBody.
\end{minted}
and for multiple residents houses another output variable for predicting a \texttt{Person} performing the activity is necessary:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(Activity, Time, Person) :-
  ruleBody.
\end{minted}
The \texttt{ruleBody} is made of rules encoded in the background knowledge which serves as features, extracting relevant informations form house signals.

  \section{Scripted data} % WHY I chose this that and that!!!!!!!!!!!!
As the format of the rule is determined, the next step it to design the features building the rule body. To this end, an insight into how to distinguish particular activities is needed. Scripted CASAS datasets (see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:csasDataDet}}) are of great help. Their careful analysis can reveal patterns that can be learnt to differentiate activities.
% by their careful examination

    \subsection{Sequential multi-class model for single resident\label{ch:smcm}}
Beside target rule specification, model assumptions need to be stated. Based on CASAS scripted data it is clear that activities are sequential and they do not overlap (see \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:timepoints}}). Hence, the problem is single-label, \emph{multi-class}---there is always one label to be assign to a time point and this label is chosen from a set which usually has cardinality $>2$.

    \subsection{Basic activities\label{sec:basicActibities}}
To start model learning I selected two activities: \emph{cook} and \emph{phone call}, and generated my impression of them for one resident based on CASAS description. Therefore, the resulting synthetic dataset is simple, completed, noiseless and resemble real life activities. Such a simple learning task helped me to familiarise myself with \texttt{Aleph} data analysis mechanisms and discover its basic capabilities and limitations.

      \subsubsection{Encode activities}
I decided to script a simple scenario in the house given in the \emph{Figure~\ref{fig:simHouse}}. A person starts in the hall with random location; he moves to the living room; activity \emph{phone\_call} starts; approaches the phone book (finds a phone number); moves to the fixed phone (talks for some time); activity \emph{phone\_call} ends. Then the person goes to the kitchen; the activity \emph{cook} starts; he approaches and uses hob for some time; the activity stops when he turns off the hob. Finally, the person goes back to hall via living room.\\

The detailed knowledge of steps taken by the agent allows to design basic features and test them. As produced by the generator data are in CASAS log format they are next converted into facts representation. Then, the logical signal representation is joined with house facts to produce basic background knowledge file. Additionally, during conversion step positives and negatives are produced. Hence, all basic components for ILP learning are present.

      \subsubsection{Design features}
Nevertheless, to build the activity rule body feature rules need to be added to background knowledge. Based on the script used to generate data I know that both activities can be distinguished by \emph{location}: phone call happens in the living room and cooking in the kitchen. Moreover, for both activities different devices and items are used: for the first the phone book and the fixed phone; for the latter hob.\\

Therefore, this simple model should work with just these two features. The basic building block of both of them is a \texttt{Prolog} predicate which interacts with sensor readings. Its main task is to check each sensor (input/output variable \texttt{SensorID}) status (input/output variable \texttt{SensorState}) at given time (input variable \texttt{Time}). As there are multiple time representation additional (input/output \texttt{TimeType}) variable is needed to represent it, leading to the rule of the form:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
sensor_state(SensorID, SensorState, TimeType, Time) :-
  ruleBody.
\end{minted}
For simplicity, in my activity recognition model, input \texttt{Time} and input/output \texttt{SensorID} variables are sufficient. Through the task only the \emph{sequential} time representation is used and \emph{activated} sensors are of interest. Therefore, the above rule can be wrapped to provide the interface to the sensor states resulting in:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
sensor_state(SensorID, Time) :-
  sensor_state(SensorID, true, sequence, Time).
\end{minted}
Presented here rule is highly customisable as it facilitates time representation selection and allow to condition on deactivated sensors if needed.\\
All \texttt{Prolog} rules are built by logical constrains leading to correct answer. For \texttt{sensor\_state} rule to be true, the sensor \texttt{SensorID} had to be activated at most at time \texttt{Time}, and after that time (until now) \texttt{SensorID} have not been deactivated. These two conditions warrant correct sensor status checks.\\
Moreover, as \texttt{Prolog} uses a search space to ``answer'' queries variables can be both rule input and output. The first approach is mainly used to check correctness of belief---all variables are initialised and either \texttt{true} or \texttt{false} is returned. The latter method uses uninitialised variables so that \texttt{Prolog} can find their unifications that yield \texttt{true} evaluation of the rule; it is worth to mention that multiple results can be returned.\\

The \texttt{sensor\_state} rule covers both \emph{item} and \emph{motion sensor}. It is worth separating the two aforementioned cases to improve model clarity. With use of house-specific background knowledge motion sensor IDs can be associated with rooms and item sensor IDs with devices and items.\\
Therefore, the device rule can be easily constructed as:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
device(Time, Device) :-
  sensor_state(SensorID, Time),
  sensorActivity(SensorID, Device).
\end{minted}
The location rule could be created in similar manner, i.e.:\\
\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
location(Time, Location) :-
  sensor_state(SensorID, Time),
  sensorInRoom(SensorID, Location).
\end{minted}
but this simplification causes \emph{discontinuous} location predictions. To fix it, a case when none of the motion sensors is activated needs to be covered. By introducing a small bias and using last known location (self-recursion with decreasing time) in such cases a continuous prediction is ensured.\\

Finally, all the three rules have to be appended to the \texttt{Aleph}'s background knowledge file to be used in learning process.

      \subsubsection{Configure \texttt{Aleph}}
Both \texttt{location} and \texttt{device} features presented above are used to build the first activity recognition model. To this end, \texttt{Aleph} needs to be correctly configured.\\
The most important settings are \texttt{noise} and \texttt{minpos} parameters. The first one determines the maximal number of negative examples that the activity rule can cover---impurity of the rule. The latter sets the minimal number of positive examples that the rule has to cover.\\
These values are set to $5$ and $1$ respectively. The first is based on observational results, and the later is lowest possible value so that every possible rule is discovered. Unfortunately, setting \texttt{minpos} to $1$ results in many singleton rules---copies of positive examples---appearing in the output theory; additional script is used to remove them.\\

The next type of settings determines parameters of the target model. \texttt{determination} settings indicate the \emph{name} and \emph{arity} of predicates that can contribute to the target rule body. \texttt{modeh} and \texttt{modeb} determine structure of rule \emph{head} and \emph{body} respectively. Both mode declarations set:
\begin{itemize}
\item a number specifying successful calls to specified predicate or a * symbol to set bounded non-determinacy\footnote{See \texttt{Aleph} manual for detail: \url{http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/activities/machlearn/Aleph/aleph.html}};
\item a name of predicate to be called, together with variable type specification.
\end{itemize}
By large, modes define how to call predicates used in the body of activity recognition model; they set whether variables should be an input (a + symbol); output (a - symbol); or a constant (\# symbol).\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
:- set( noise,  3 ).
:- set( minpos, 1 ).

:- determination( activity/2, device/2   ).
:- determination( activity/2, location/2 ).

:- modeh( *, activity(#activityIDs, +integer) ).
:- modeb( *, device(+integer, #deviceIDs)     ).
:- modeb( *, location(+integer, #roomIDs)     ).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Example \texttt{Aleph} configuration header.\label{lst:alephConfHead}}
\end{figure}

The example header is presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephConfHead}}. Other than aforementioned settings are left default.\\
Finally, the last step before running the algorithm is attaching the \texttt{Aleph} configuration to the background knowledge file.

      \subsubsection{Learn the model}
As the \texttt{Aleph} learning process is interactive a special script is designed to improve the work-flow. The script runs the \texttt{Aleph}, loads the needed files: background, positives and negatives; learns the activity theory; and finally saves it to a file.\\
Then, the model is purified by removing singleton rules and retaining ones with non-empty body.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
activity(phone_call,A) :-
  device(A,phone_book).
activity(phone_call,A) :-
  device(A,phone).
activity(cook,A) :-
  device(A,burner).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Basic activity recognition model.\label{lst:alephBasicModel}}
\end{figure}

Learnt rules presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephBasicModel}} make perfect sense with regard to used data generation script. Moreover, identified and encoded features behave as intended extracting relevant information from the signal. Finally, the \texttt{location} feature does not appear in the model as it is uninformative in this case---see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:closedConcept}} for details.

      \subsubsection{Evaluate results}
The activity recognition model built with presented above components is rather simplistic: it uses only one feature---see \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephBasicModel}}.\\

To evaluation performance of the above model I use 10 folds cross-validation. Each fold is generated according to the same activity script but with small variations in the motion path. The evaluation results are presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{tab:basicStats}}. Overall, the model achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{91.5\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{1}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.37}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.54}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ r | l l}
cook & true & false\\
\hline
positive & 90 & 0\\
negative & 2520 & 90\\
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{tabular}{ r | l l}
phone\_call & true & false\\
\hline
positive & 180 & 0\\
negative & 2151 & 369\\
  \end{tabular}
  \begin{tabular}{ r | l l}
all & true & false\\
\hline
positive & 270 & 0\\
negative & 4671 & 459\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Cross-validation results.\label{tab:basicStats}}
\end{figure}

These results can be compared with the basic model predicting majority class out of three available: \emph{cook}, \emph{phone call} and \emph{no activity}. As their distribution is roughly uniform in designed script the majority class prediction achieves accuracy of \textbf{36.84\%}, \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.51}, \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.54}, and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.52}.\\
Comparing both activity recognition models indicates that rule based classification is superior to majority class prediction in this simple scenario.\\

Analysis of the confusion matrices and the model reveals that \emph{false negative} predictions are mainly caused by prediction discontinuity and lack of informative features in the data---see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:predictionDiscontinuity}}.\\

With comprehensive analysis of ILP application to basic smart-house data I proceed to more difficult case.

    \subsection{CASAS flavoured activities}
The next step is to reproduce CASAS \#1 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Normal Testbed scripted data presented in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:csasDataDet}} as faithfully as possible. The main difference is complete lack of noise to make feature design easier.

      \subsubsection{CASAS features}
The main advantage of this dataset is a script explaining step-by-step actions contributing to the five labelled activities. To design features capable of classifying these activities I identified their characteristic features.\\

The phone call uses two specific to this activity items: phone book and fixed phone. Therefore, this activity can be identified using previously designed \texttt{device} feature. The phone call rules are the same as the ones shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephBasicModel}}.\\

The hand washing activity requires use of water. Moreover, unlike in cleaning and cooking tasks all the items stored in the cupboard are in place. These observations lead to two new features: \texttt{waterUsed(T)}---which checks whether at time $T$ wither hot or cold water was used; and \texttt{outOfCabinet(T,ItemList)}---which finds items removed from cupboard at time $T$.\\

The next activity recorded in the CASAS dataset is cooking. The first is hob being on detected with \texttt{device} feature, the second is based on past observation. The streaming scenario of smart-house data allows to use past activity prediction as feature. In CASAS data cooking can be predicted if some items are removed from cupboard and the resident has not been cooking in ``recent past''.\\
The first condition is checked by \texttt{outOfCabinet(T,L)} to find items taken out of cupboard and \texttt{nonEmpty(L)} to ensure that it is not empty. The latter, is based on \texttt{notCooked(T)} feature, which checks whether in sliding time window of fixed length (10 events in this experiment) the activity cooking was predicted.\\

Finally, the prediction of last two activities: eating and washing up, is based on \emph{natural order}. To model both activities I assume that it is impossible to eat if the meal has not been cooked, and it is also impossible to wash the dishes unless a meal has been eaten.\\
I encode this assumption as prior belief in background knowledge. \texttt{activityOrder(Time, Activity)} feature returns possible activity (either eat or wash up) at current time. This ``guess'' needs to be reinforced with other conditions to build either of those two activity rules.\\
With so far designed features eating activity can be conditioned on having cooked the meal, being in the living room, and having the medicine container. For the last condition new feature \texttt{medicineInList(L)} is encoded---it checks whether the medicine container is in the list passed by input variable $L$. This list is generated with \texttt{outOfCabinet(T,L)} predicate.\\
Finally, activity of washing the dishes is conditioned on cooking a meal in the past, being in kitchen, using water, and some items being removed for cupboard.

      \subsubsection{Model learning}
To learn activity recognition model with new features presented above \texttt{Aleph} configuration has to be expanded. \emph{Determinations} and \emph{mode declarations} (modeb) are added for all new feature.\\
The model learnt for the synthetic CASAS dataset is shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:CASASmodel}}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}

  outOfCabinet(B,C),
  nonEmpty(C).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Activity recognition model for CASAS data.\label{lst:CASASmodel}}
\end{figure}

      \subsubsection{Model evaluation}
Overall, the model achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{73.12\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.78}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.9}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.84}.\\

For majority class classifier: achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{27.47\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.29}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.81}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.43}.

    \subsection{CASAS activities}
The next step is to train model on real data. For this purpose CASAS \#1 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Normal Testbed, narrated datasets for single resident is used.\\
This dataset contains 24 participants performing 5 activities of daily living, therefore, it is time consuming (about 30 hours per label) to use it as a whole. Hence, I chose the approach to split (with use of \texttt{Python} script) the dataset per single participant performing all 5 activities. Moreover, such data handling facilitates straightforward cross-validation, where each fold is one participant's data.\\
Finally, I wrote background knowledge for CASAS testbed as it cannot be generated automatically.

      \subsubsection{Data issues}
With genuine CASAS data the main barrier is noise, incompleteness and numeric output of water and burner sensors. To attempt model learning I design feature rules to be internally as immune to the data issues as possible. The noise handling on the feature level is mainly based on biasing towards previous state or prediction. Moreover, I thresholded hence, discretised CASAS burner and water sensor outputs to make them \texttt{Aleph} friendly.

      \subsubsection{Activity model}
All the features designed so far for the synthetic datasets are used to train the activity recognition model on real data. Depending on the level of noise in each trial some of the activity rules presented in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:CASASmodel}} are not constructed. Moreover, no new rules based on so far designed features are discovered.

      \subsubsection{Model evaluation}
Overall, the model achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{63.24\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.60}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.95}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.74}.\\

For majority class classifier: achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{27.94\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.32}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.67}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.43}.

    \subsection{CASAS activities with errors}
Finally, model learnt on the genuine CASAS \#1 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Normal Testbed is evaluated against CASAS \#2 WSU Smart Apartment ADL Error Testbed. The purpose of this experiment is to examine behaviour of model when activities diverge from original model assumptions.\\

Overall, the model achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{46.86\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.54}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.77}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.63}.\\

For majority class classifier: achieves \emph{accuracy} of \textbf{28.74\%}; \emph{precision} of \textbf{0.32}; \emph{recall} of \textbf{0.73}; and \emph{F-measure} of \textbf{0.44}.

    \subsection{Overlapping activities\label{sec:singleML}}
Despite the initial assumption of the model being \emph{sequential} it is feasible to generalise it to a case where activities overlap i.e.\ predict multiple labels (activities) at any time. A simple example can be created by modifying the activity script presented in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:basicActibities}} so that the person first starts cooking by turning on the hob; then moves to the living room where phone call activity starts; he searches the phone book and uses fixed phone; next the person returns to the kitchen to turn off the hob---activity cooking stops; finally, he returns to the hall.\\
This simple activity script embeds phone call inside cooking block, therefore, multi-label prediction is needed. The proposed generator is capable of creating such datasets, hence, model extension is discussed on described above toy example.\\

As \texttt{Prolog} natively supports multiple answers to a query it is possible to apply ILP to multi-label setting without any modifications. A \texttt{location} query returns all active locations (not possible in noiseless single resident case), and \texttt{device} all items and appliances used at given time. For the simple case described above the output theory is identical to sequential model shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:alephBasicModel}}.\\

The models similarity, and in this particular case identity, is an important discovery. A model learnt for sequential activities can be used with non-sequential data and with some exceptions vice versa.\\
This feature of ILP may become particularly handy when learning multi-label case is hard. In such cases, model learnt on the same activities performed sequentially could be used.\\
Finally, as multiple residents cases are multi-label problem by definition sequential models can be applied, nevertheless, they will not identify the resident associated with activity.

  \section{Unscripted data}
Presented above work shows the approach when activity details are available. Such datasets are rare as they need special testbed and activity preparation as well as human annotation. Moreover, so far learnt models mainly depend on item sensors and prior activity believes, with little use of motion sensors and location information.\\

In this section I consider more common and more difficult to model unscripted datasets. This problem is hard to tackle as beside main objective of the activity little is known about it. Moreover, item sensors which were the main support for so far learnt models are unpopular in majority of activities of daily living therefore in this section I focus on structures encoded via motion sensors. By large, in unscripted cases feature design is more of guesswork and intuition rather than systematic data analysis.

    \subsection{Multi-label model for multiple residents\label{ch:mlm}}
The data collected from house occupied by multiple residents are a mixture of sensor activations caused by each person interacting with the house. There are two main goals in modelling such data: first, recognise an activity; second, assign the activity to a resident.\\
A straight forward approach is to separate sensor activations per person and use single resident model. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve in ILP, hence, different approach has to be identified.\\

In this model I assume that each resident performs at most one activity at a time. Moreover, each resident has assigned bedroom to which only he has access, therefore, all bedroom sensor activations are caused by himself.\\
As there are two predictions to make: activity and person, two errors are possible. Hence, evaluation measure for multi-resident activity recognition model has to be chosen. For this particular application accuracy for each resident-activity pair together with their marginals should suffice.\\

The greatest difficulty in such models is the event of resident's path crossing and sharing common areas. The threat in such cases is that it is fairly easy to mix them up and relatively hard to label them again. The canonical multi-resident activity example containing the above features is \emph{bedroom-toilet} problem.

    \subsection{Bedroom-toilet problem}
The two residents case is the simplest scenario of multiple residents house. It is both used in CASAS datasets and commonly described in the literature, therefore, I focus on this particular quantity. Moreover, for this particular model only motion sensor readings are available.\\

The bedroom-toilet problem is the most basic activity of daily living for multiple residents. It is set in a house where both bedrooms share a common hall which leads to a bathroom. In this environment one of the residents stays in his room, while the other goes to the bathroom and returns to his room via the hall. For the person staying in his room all the time there are two possibilities: first, he can stay still, what resembles sleeping; second, he can move, what resembles working.\\

In this work I focus on recognising only two activities \emph{in the room} and \emph{outside of the room} and assigning them to the residents.

    \subsection{Synthetic multiple residents}
First, a dataset is generated according to the above description. The dataset is noiseless and the person staying in the bedroom is wandering around his room while the other person goes to the bathroom.

      \subsubsection{Multiple residents features---lack of noise}
The \texttt{Prolog}'s ability to return more than one answer is of great importance for multiple resident case. Lack of noise guarantees simultaneous prediction of two active locations (using motion sensors) in the house, and possibly more than one item used.\\
Not all so far designed features for single resident case support multiple answers, therefore, all rules are extended to facilitate it. Moreover, by default \texttt{Aleph} does not use multiple outputs generated by rule body predicates, hence, wrappers are created with \texttt{findall} \texttt{Prolog} predicate to return lists instead of constants.\\

In this model initial person identification is achieved by person-bedroom assignment---it is represented as fact in background knowledge. As no item sensor are used activity recognition is only based on motion sensors.\\

Rules for two activities have to be constructed: being in the room and being outside of the room. The first one is based on the assumption that if motion sensors in one of the bedrooms are activated the owner of the room is in it.\\
To this end \texttt{locations} feature returning list of rooms with activated motion sensors is used. \emph{roomInLocations} predicate is used to check whether one of the bedrooms is in this list; if so the owner of the bedroom (\texttt{bedroom} predicate) together with activity \emph{in the room} (\texttt{roomActivity} predicate) is returned.\\

The activity of being outside of the bedroom is detected based on one of the detected locations (\texttt{locations} predicate) not being bedroom (\texttt{hallbathroomLocations} predicate). In such case activity of being \emph{outside of the bedroom} is predicted (\texttt{roomActivity} predicate). To infer the identity of this person activation of bedroom sensors is checked (\texttt{roomInLocations} predicate) and resident whose bedroom does not cause these activations is returned (\texttt{bedroom} and \texttt{allPeopleBut} predicates).

      \subsubsection{Activity model}
The target activity recognition model for bedroom-toilet two resident case is given in \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:BTtwo}}.\\

      \subsubsection{Noise compatible features}
As there exists location discontinuity in prediction space it needs to be make continuous, unfortunately due to multiple Prolog results it cannot be done in the same way as in single resident scenario—bias the location prediction toward last known location.\\

Locations = [room\_1, room\_2].
no action is needed. In case one location is returned,
Locations = [room\_1].
and previous location prediction had this answer the list is appended with the missing one.

If one location is returned and it was not previously discovered:
Locations = [ hall].
use
connected(A, B, Path)
This predicate returns path from room A to B including both locations. Check the connection of current prediction with both predictions from last known two-solution. If there is immediate connection: on hop, to one of the room append the other to the list. The issue is common space in one hop distance---it is my next step.

More than locations returned than \# residents in the house:\\
Locations = [room\_1, room\_2, hall].\\
The idea is to check for sensor changes in each room in sliding time window -- if signal still the resident is out---remove his room---the longest standing sensor.\\
Fortunately CASAS twor2009 bedroom-toilet activity combination give mostly two locations.

  \section{Signal features\label{sec:single:features}\label{sec:multiple:features}}
I show in described above activity recognition models all the features used to build them. Majority of them is designed to pick up specific signal characteristic therefore they are used for small number of activity rules. This feature's ``selectiveness'' property allows to store only raw data and extract features ``on demand''.\\
With each new dataset examined with ILP the database of features expands. Majority of those features are not data specific---they extract signal properties via house background knowledge. Therefore, such database is of great help when dealing with new datasets, about which little is known.\\

All three: the fact signal representation, the house background knowledge, and the feature rules can be used as generative model for signal's features. With well designed rules signal issues such as noise and incompleteness can be fixed. This in turn would result in smoothed-out dataset hence remedy any signal continuity problems. Transformed in such way datasets can be more informative hence lead to better classification results.\\
Finally, as \texttt{Prolog} is interpreted language its query interface can be used to easily examine the dataset by hand with designed earlier features. Using this technique data structure can be discovered and effectiveness of the features can be evaluated.

  \section{Discontinuity problem\label{sec:predictionDiscontinuity}}
Noise and incompleteness of the data are great difficulty when building activity recognition model. Both of them can cause two main discontinuity problems: intermittent sensor signals and model activity predictions.

    \subsection{Signal discontinuity}
Signal discontinuity is hard to be fixed for item and appliance sensors and relatively easy for motion sensors. Either random sensor activations or motion sensor dead zones can cause intermittent signal feed leading to unknown resident location for some periods of time. As I use information delivered by motion sensors in form of \texttt{location} predicate the discontinuity problem can be easily fixed. When none of the motion sensors is active the \texttt{location} predicate assumes the last known resident location (see \emph{Section~\ref{sec:basicActibities}} for details). Such approach greatly improves the \texttt{location} feature capabilities but introduces bias which can cause troubles when the resident leaves the house.

    \subsection{Prediction discontinuity}
Continuity issue is also present in activity recognition rules. Many of them are based on particular sensor conditions therefore between such events the prediction is not possible. For example, phone call rule presented in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:basicActibities}} is supported on phone and phone book events. Between browsing the phone book and talking on the phone there are only uninformative motion sensor readings caused by the resident moving from the first item to the latter.\\
This period of time is difficult to label using signal features, nevertheless, it can be assign to phone call activity by wrapping the activity model within \emph{meta-rule} that smooths out the predictions---see \emph{Figure~\ref{lst:metaActivity}}.

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \begin{minted}[bgcolor=Bkgd,frame=leftline]{Prolog}
metaActivity(Activity, Time) :-
  activity(Activity, Time),
  Time >= 0, !.

metaActivity(Activity, Time) :-
  !, Time > 0,
  metaActivity(Activity, Time-1).
  \end{minted}
  \caption{Example meta-activity rules.\label{lst:metaActivity}}
\end{figure}

To evaluate possible improvements achieved with proposed meta-rule, 10 fold cross-validation on both \emph{base rules} and base rules accessed via \emph{meta-rules} is performed. The dataset used for evaluation is synthesised based on two CASAS-like activities: phone call and cooking---similar to the example presented in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:basicActibities}}.\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ r | l l l l }
 & Accuracy & Precision & Recall & F-measure\\
\hline
base rules & 60.76\% & 1 & 0.17 & 0.29\\
meta rules & 84.56\% & 0.87 & 0.80 & 0.83 \\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Meta-rule improvement.\label{tab:metaImprovement}}
\end{figure}

The experiment results are shown in \emph{Figure~\ref{tab:metaImprovement}}. In general, the meta-rule improves the classification results by correctly labelling points previously given false negative label. E.g.\ time between using the phone book and the phone is not assign any label in \emph{base rule} case, and in \emph{meta-rule} case phone call label is given.\\

Both continuity fixes for sensors and activities have a significant disadvantage. In case the resident leaves the house and sensors do not recognise that event a false prediction of long time span is produced. This bias can be improved in both cases by monitoring time for which each sensor is on---the average of 40 seconds is given in the literature---and discarding any sensor readings that does not fit that time window.

  \section{Model generality}
Vast majority of presented here rules access raw signals via names and not with data specific sensor IDs. This design approach guarantees generality of the built activity rules. By using house specific background knowledge the rules can be applied to many other datasets which could be based on slightly varying testbed design.\\
Another type of model generality is presented in \emph{Section~\ref{sec:singleML}}. Due to mentioned there \texttt{Prolog} capabilities model based on sequential activities can be applied to overlapping ones and vice versa.\\

Finally, this model generality property leads to possibility of applying real data based models to the ones learnt on synthetic data and vice versa. This approach is used as one of the model evaluation techniques.

\chapter{Conclusion and future work\label{ch:summary}}
My work in the field of activity recognition focused on identifying capabilities and limitation of inductive logic programming technique in learning activities of daily living recognition model from smart-house data. To this end, I recognised issues with real dataset causing learning difficulties. To mitigate these issues and examine ILP capabilities I built highly customisable smart-house data generator. It allowed me to focus on building activity recognition model for single and multiple residents on synthetic data, therefore, not worry about technical signal issues like noise, incompleteness, and lack of detailed ground truth. Finally, after identifying ILP capabilities I addressed handling real data issues.

  \section{Smart-house data generator} % degree
One of the field contributions presented in this work is smart-house data generator. It is highly customisable and to the best of test results, it produces real-like data within reasonable margin error.\\
It proven to be particularly helpful in building the rule-based model. Possibility to test undocumented machine learning algorithms on perfectly known data helps to determine its capabilities. Then, generalising the solution to real data restricts to addressing noise and incompleteness issues.\\

Proposed here work-flow allows researchers to solve one problem at a time. They first can evaluate model for given application area by encoding in the data variety of activities to be learn. Once, model limitations are discovered they can focus on overcoming real data issues.

  \section{Rule based Activity Recognition Model}
In this work I showed rule models for variety of basic activities of daily living. I attempted scripted and unscripted data; models based on item and motion sensors; learning real and synthetic datasets; finally, analysing one and multiple residents cases.\\
The learning objective was to address activities commonly described in the literature and ones that are tagged as ``hard to learn'' therein.\\

Presented here ILP activity recognition models were designed in a way that real power of used components could be harnessed. Especially, ILP features not available in other machine learning techniques.\\
In general, quality of model highly depends on designed features. If correct data believes are translated into \texttt{Prolog} rules in order to extract highly informative features then one can expect the model to behave well.\\
Presented here analysis provides satisfactory results and indicates that with more analysed data and discovered hidden there structures the general activity recognition model can be built.

  \section{Work evaluation} % what my results mean to general public
Presented here approach to smart-house data can greatly benefit researchers addressing activity recognition tasks. Generated by ILP \texttt{Prolog} rules describing activities are human-readable. In contrary to black-box methods which just output classification results, ILP output can be easily analysed to identify interesting data structures and dependencies.\\
This detailed data knowledge also helps in features design. As many features are common for more than one type of activity, ones discovered for scripted data can be used to identify structure of unscripted data.\\

Furthermore, my work addresses many well known ILP issues. Proposed here approach to time and real-valued variables handling can find variety of applications in different fields.\\

Finally, the smart-house data generator is proven to be sound. It is highly customisable and guaranties precision and high control over output data. As it is publicly available many researchers who are building activity-recognition models will find it of invaluable help for their work. Finally, large user community can significantly improve the generator functioning as all bugs will be identified during usage and reported to be fixed.

  \section{Further development}
Presented here strong points of rule based models can be utilised by including it in an activity recognition classifier ensemble. By combining it with other techniques best features of each classifier can be used and majority of individual weaknesses mitigated. Therefore, behaviour of ILP model should be evaluated in ensemble environment to identify potential performance improvements.

    \subsection{Model complexity}
Rule models presented in this paper are restricted to basic activities of daily living recognition for single and multiple residents. As the complexity of datasets can be arbitrarily increased by introducing new activities further learning attempts can be done. Moreover, data noise and incompleteness influence on ILP learning capabilities can be systematically evaluated. Finally, influence of common to people, systematically introduced errors while performing set activities can be examined for ILP framework.

    \subsection{Data Narrative concept\label{sec:narrative}}
Most commonly used visualisation techniques nowadays are tables, graphs, and diagrams. Unfortunately, such charts often need expertise in a field to be correctly interpreted. Moreover, aforementioned methods often trade-off clarity for completeness of shown data hence make it difficult for a broad audience to see the big picture.\\

\emph{Narrative Analysis} describes data with natural language: a \emph{succinct plain English description} of events encoded in selected time-space window. Despite its power, this form of data representation has been under-appreciated and devoted little attention in recent years.\\
Data narration can be found in modern smart-phone weather and calendar applications where instead of detailed weather forecast or hour-by-hour calendar schedule, one sentence description is presented to the user. In combination with other visualisation techniques it has been proven as an effective method of expressing corporate financial data. Moreover, deep learning algorithms have been applied to images to generate captions---succinct scene descriptions~\citep{vinyals2014show}.\\

Successful adaptation of \emph{narrative analytics} to smart-house data would greatly benefit healthcare applications. Delivering comprehensible activity description within given time-space window and with level of detail tuned to a particular recipient would provide invaluable monitoring and diagnostic tool for day-care personnel and medical staff. Activities transparently expressed as English sentences gives possibility to quickly understand status of the system without time-consuming raw-data or charts interpretation.\\
Furthermore, proposed here descriptive mechanisms could be extended to become a query-enabled database. In such a model user could ``ask'' a question in natural language to get narrative answer instead of numerical vector.\\

% generative framework
Proposed in this paper rule based activity recognition model can become foundation for advanced \emph{Narrative Analtics} tool. \texttt{Prolog} is well known for great natural language processing capabilities, therefore, activity rules can be translated into plain English data description.
